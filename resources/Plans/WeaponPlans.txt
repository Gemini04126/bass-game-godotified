--== WEAPONS AND MODULES? ==--
When defeated, Robot Masters give Bass a WEAPON and a MODULE

WEAPON: Special Weapons are weapons that have limited ammunition but are more powerful than your regular buster.

MODULE: An item that gives you passive boosts, such as a double jump or shadow dash.

You can use either a boss's weapon or their module, but not both. You can switch them out from the stage select.

--== SHOP ITEMS ==--

(Weapon) Bass Buster
A rapid fire buster that fires regular shots, up to 5 on screen. Shots cannot pass through walls.

(Weapon) Spread Buster
A slower firing buster that fires triple spread shots.

(Weapon) Bass Buster Type-F
A semi automatic buster that fires more powerful shots that cannot be aimed, up to 3 on screen at a time. You can hold down the button to charge it up to 2 levels.


(Module) HP Up Parts 1

--== OTHER UNLOCKABLES ==--

(Weapon) Treble Boost
The Mega Man Killers, now known as the Bass Bashers, have stolen Treble and pulled the Evil Energy out of him to power themselves up.
All this ends up doing to Treble is reverting the wing design for Treble Boost to the MM7 one.
Otherwise, it functions identically to the usual.

--== BLAZE MAN ==--

(Weapon) Scorch Barrier
A shield much like Water Shield that incinerates enemies and projectiles alike. You can release the attack to fly forward at enemies in a spiraling attack. It burns wood, incinerates trash, and melts any ice you touch while using it. It's only drawback is that it generates very slowly. The particles act like Junk shields, being trailed clusters

(Module) Houshou-geki 鳳昇撃 (Phoenix's Rising Attack)
An upwards dash that kinda works as a super double jump and hurts enemies directly below you by sending flames from bass's legs downwards.

--== VIDEO MAN ==--
