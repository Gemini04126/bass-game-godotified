	Bass: Ooh, looks like I'm famous. What did I do to become so popular?
	Blaze Man: Attack my creator, destroy his lab, and crush many of my fellow Robot Masters.
	Bass: Oh, so you're one of Light's robots! Come to take revenge, huh? I'll make sure to enjoy myself!

	Copy Robot: Ooh, looks like you're brighter than your lame flames! I'm just like him, so I'm surprised!
	Blaze Man: He is a DLN-series, like me. I consider him a brother. Your facade is an insult us all!
	Copy Robot: Call me "Big Bro", then. Time to punish you for disrespecting your family!
